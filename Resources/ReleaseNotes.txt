1.2:
    Thanks to <jeff@lockerman.org>, I modified some class names from 2DLineXXX to UI2DLineXXX, because digits as first char of class name is not good.
    If you already use some of these classes, follow these steps:
        a.Find config file in your (UE4Project)/Config/DefaultEngine.ini
        b.Find or add line [/Script/Engine.Engine]
        c.Add these lines under [/Script/Engine.Engine]:
            +ActiveClassRedirects=(OldClassName="/Script/LGUI.2DLineChildrenAsPoints",NewClassName="/Script/LGUI.UI2DLineChildrenAsPoints")
            +ActiveClassRedirects=(OldClassName="/Script/LGUI.2DLineChildrenAsPointsActor",NewClassName="/Script/LGUI.UI2DLineChildrenAsPointsActor")
            +ActiveClassRedirects=(OldClassName="/Script/LGUI.2DLineRaw",NewClassName="/Script/LGUI.UI2DLineRaw")
            +ActiveClassRedirects=(OldClassName="/Script/LGUI.2DLineActor",NewClassName="/Script/LGUI.UI2DLineActor")
            +ActiveClassRedirects=(OldClassName="/Script/LGUI.2DLineRendererBase",NewClassName="/Script/LGUI.UI2DLineRendererBase")
            +ActiveClassRedirects=(OldClassName="/Script/LGUI.2DLineRing",NewClassName="/Script/LGUI.UI2DLineRing")
            +ActiveClassRedirects=(OldClassName="/Script/LGUI.2DLineRingActor",NewClassName="/Script/LGUI.UI2DLineRingActor")
            +ActiveClassRedirects=(OldClassName="/Script/LGUI.2DLineRingFrame",NewClassName="/Script/LGUI.UI2DLineRingFrame")
            +ActiveClassRedirects=(OldClassName="/Script/LGUI.2DLineRingFrameActor",NewClassName="/Script/LGUI.UI2DLineRingFrameActor")
    After these steps, the engine should should recognize these new classes.
1.3:
    Change some editor icon.
    Add new editor enter on toolbar, with LGUI icon button.
    Add new editor helper function "Change Trace Channel", this can quickly change UI element's trace channel with hierarchy.

1.4:
    Fix some bugs
    Replace editor update with FTickableObject.
1.5:
    Expose more interface to blueprint(most is layout component).
    Add UVRect property to UITexture, so UITexture can choose a rect area to show texture. If any prefab contains the UITexture component, then you should recreate that prefab.
    Modify UIRoot for editor simulation mode. When you use overlay UI by SceneCapture2D, you can eject player and hide UI.
    Show drawcall count on UIPanel's details panel.
    Fix edit mode update issue.
    Fix a crash caused by UISprite tiled mode.
1.6:
    Fix a bug that cause an error and stop cook process.
    Add more alignment options for layout control.
1.7:
    Fix some bugs.
    Improve performance of UITexture's tiled mode and UISprite's tiled mode.
1.8:
    Fix LTween crash issue.
    ActorSerializer(PrefabSystem) and ActorCopier now support instanced object property.
    LGUIComponentReference add blueprint support.
1.9:
    Fix a crash caused by ActorSerializer.
    Add UENUM support for LGUIDrawableEvent.
    UI2DLine add "grow" feature, can grow line from start to end.
    Change LGUIEditor's rule of duplicate object's name.
1.10:
    Fix some bugs.
    Modify layout and editor.
1.11:
    Fix some bugs.
    Fix bug: crash caused by UITextInputComponent, when select text content.
    Fix LTween's InOutBack ease type error.
    Add preset interaction components, LGUIScreenSpaceInteraction/LGUIWorldSpaceInteraction, for quick setup.
    Add "Screen Space UI" and "World Space UI" preset setup at editor "LGUI Tools/Basic Setup".
    Add "Replace UI Elements" at editor "LGUI Tools/Replace UI Elements".
1.12:
    Fix:
        screen space UI alpha blend problem.
    Upgrade:
        prefab: when select a actor, drag to create prefab will attach to that actor.
	    editor: ReplaceUIElement now can keep and replace object reference.
    Modify:
        Avoid using GWorld, so LoadPrefab must provide a object to get world.
    New feature:
        A new column on SceneOutliner, provide ability to create/modify UI direct in SceneOutliner.
1.13:
    Fix:
        material's IsFontTexture property not set correctly.
    New feature:
        save scene outliner's hierarchy state(actor's folder) before play, and restore it after end play.
1.14:
    Fix:
        button "Create Prefab" not create content.
        some crash fixed.
    Update:
        change UIItem's base class UPrimitiveComponent to USceneComponent, this can save a lot of disk space and memory.
            But!!!!! You Need To Recreate Your Prefab Which Contains LGUI Elemnt.
        add RenderTargetSizeMultiply for UIRoot, increase this value can perform a supersampleing thing.
    New feature:
        (still under develop)Add a button to UIRoot component named "Open Screen Space UI Viewer", which can open a window to preview Screen Space UI.
        Save scene outliner's hierarchy state now support save and open map.
2.0:
    Screen space UI (Or HUD) not get a huge performance update. The 1.x version use SceneCapture2D, which is vary bad on performance. But now the new 2.x version of LGUI's HUD, is render direct on screen, no additional performance cost!
    Remove UIPanel, use LGUICanvas to render all UI elements.
    Remove UIRoot, LGUICanvas and LGUICanvasScaler will do the job.
2.1:
    Fix:
        Screen space UI sort order problem.
        UITextInputComponent more stable.
    Update:
        Change default rotate from (-90, 0, 90) to (-90, 0, 0).
        Replace LGUIEventSystemActor with LGUIEventSystem component.
        Modify for 2DLineRendererBase, remove CurrentPointArray property, add UseGrowValue to determin whether or not use grow value.
    New feature:
        Add uiScale property to LGUICanvas, maybe useful in future.
2.2ï¼š
    Fix:
        Fix a bug of UITextInputComponent multi line edit.
        Screen space UI render issue.
    New feature:
        Navigation support, eg: use tab key to navigate to next UISelectableComponent. Call NavigationXXX function in LGUIEventSystem.
        UITextInputComponent support ignore keys, canbe useful for navigation. 
        LGUIComponentReference now support multiple component of same type on same actor, all we need to do is just click and select a component.
2.3:
    Fix:
        Fix crash when add LGUICanvas in blueprint actor. But blueprint actor for LGUI is still not recommended.
    Modify:
        Rename LTween's XXXGetterFunction to LTweenXXXGetterFunction, and same change to XXXSettterFunction.
    New feature:
        LGUIFont now can pack font texture into UISprite's atlas texture! This can be very helpful to reduce drawcall. All we need to do is to change LGUIFont's packingTag property to a UISprite's packingTag.
        Create folder for LGUIPrefab actor in SceneOutliner.
2.3.1
	Fix:
